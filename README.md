# Skin-disease-detection-cnn
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning project for detecting and classifying skin diseases from images. Built using TensorFlow/Keras, the model helps in early diagnosis by identifying disease types from dermatological images.

## About the Project
Skin diseases are one of the most common medical conditions worldwide. Accurate and early detection can help in proper treatment and reduce the chances of complications. However, many people do not have access to timely diagnosis due to a lack of dermatologists or awareness.
This project aims to build an AI-based skin disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to classify images of skin conditions into different disease categories with high accuracy.

## Dataset Details
Source: Kaggle
Type: Dermatology image dataset
Format: Image
Number of Classes: 2
Total Images: 2000+

## Model Architecture
This project uses Transfer Learning with the pretrained ResNet50 model from the ImageNet dataset. ResNet50 is a deep convolutional neural network with 50 layers and has shown excellent performance in image classification tasks.
